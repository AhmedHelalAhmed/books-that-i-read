- Microservices is an architecture choice.
- Microservices are independently releasable services.
- Each service encapsulate functionality and make it accessible to other services via network.
- Microservises can use different technologies.
- Each service treated as a black box.
- Each service hosts business functionality on one or more endpoints.
- Each service hide the technology and encapsulates its own database.
- Microservices avoid the use of shared databases.
- Microservices support the concepts of information hiding.
- Each service don't change in backward-incompatible fashion.
- Microservices works on isolation and releasable on demand.
- Microservices comes to provide loosely coupled services.
- SOA: service oriented architecture in it some of services cooperates to build the system but everything coupled to a database and had to deploy everything together.
- Microservices means independent deployability.
- Microservices requires loosely coupled services.
- Microservices requires explicit well-defined and stable contracts between services.
- Model services around business domains.
- Services must be end-to-end slices of business logic and data.
- Size: the goal of microservices is to have as small an interface as possible.
- more services means the complexity of the system will be more.
- Flexibility: the architecture should help us to solve the problems we might face in the future.
- Microservices is an alternative to monolithic architecture.
- Monoliths means unit of deployment when all functionality in a system must be deployed together.
